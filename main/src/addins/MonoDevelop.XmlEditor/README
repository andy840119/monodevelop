This is an XML Editor add-in for MonoDevelop. The code has
been ported from the SharpDevelop XML Editor.  Please see
http://md-xed.sourceforge.net for more information.

Requirement
-----------

MonoDevelop from the repository has been installed:

http://svn.myrealbox.com/viewcvs/trunk/monodevelop/


Compiling for users
-------------------

./configure --prefix=/the/path/where/monodevelop/was/installed
make
make install


Compiling for developers
------------------------

To compile run the following command:

./autogen.sh --prefix=/the/path/where/monodevelop/was/installed
make
make install


Compiling using MonoDevelop
---------------------------

The source code includes a MonoDevelop project file src/MonoDevelop.XmlEditor.mds
which can be used to build the code.  

If MonoDevelop was installed to /home/username then putting the source code from 
the repository into /home/username/src/md-xmleditor should mean the project 
will build without having to modify the project references.

Example folder layout:

/home/matt/lib/monodevelop/AddIns  - (MonoDevelop addins folder)
/home/matt/src/md-xmleditor        - (MonoDevelop.XmlEditor source)

The assemblies are built to the build folder, copy the XmlEditor folder and
all its files and folders to lib/monodevelop/AddIns/XmlEditor.  


Dependencies
------------
MonoDevelop >= 1.0
Mono >= 1.1.4
Gtk# >= 2.3.90
gecko-sharp >= 0.10
gtksourceview-sharp >= 0.10
